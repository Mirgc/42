** function : Cylinder intersections
**
**	Here, we work on two things. First the tube (the cylinder) and then the
**	the caps (the circles).
**
**	1. Calculate the 2 intersection points of the camera
**		ray with the cylinder. We're covering :
**			- Entry and exit through the tube
**			- Entry through cap, exit through tube
**			- Entry and exit through the caps
**		-> For that we calculate the radius from the orientation
**		of the cylinder to the direction of the camera_ray 
**		(there can be infinite radiuses).
**		-> Then we calculate from that the parallel radius that 
**		goes from the center to the camera ray. 
**		-> The radius we need (hit point to center axis) will be
**		parallel to the second one and oriented in the direction
**		of the first one.
**		-> Then we solve the equation with those elements.
**
**	2. Then we need to determine which of the two intersection
**		point is the closest to the camera (and thus the right one).
**		Note : In the quadratic function, t0 and t1 will always be
**				coming out as t0 < t1.
**
**	3. But before we're good, we still need to check if the hit
**		point is in the height of the cylinder - because our cylinder
**		is finite and not infinite :D
**		- To do that (since the point of our cylinder is basically the
**		  middle point of it) we need to calculate the length of one half
**		  AND the other half. And voilÃ .
**
**	4. Then we have the function to compute the caps.
**		Let's not forget they are objects of their own,
**		circles, and that's why the circle function is
**		never called in the cylinder calculations.
**		- To do so we treat the circles as planes (they
**			are just planes with a circle shape) and then
**			determine if the point is withing the circle
**			shape.
**
**	5. As every object, the cylinder has a specific normal.
**		Circles have the same normal as planes. (cf. Intersect_Object.c)
